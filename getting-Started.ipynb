      "**Physical Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Saturn is the eighth planet from the Sun, with a mass that is 30.7% that of Earth.\n",
      "* It is the second-largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter.\n",
      "* Saturn is larger than the planet Mercury and has a diameter that is 143,519 km (89,043 mi).\n",
      "* It has a very distinct ring system, which is composed of dust and ice particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Atmosphere:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Saturn's atmosphere is the fourth densest in the Solar System, with a mass density that is 99.8% that of water.\n",
      "* It is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases.\n",
      "* The atmosphere is divided into several distinct layers, including a troposphere, stratosphere, and thermosphere.\n",
      "* The upper atmosphere is extremely hot, with temperatures reaching up to 15,000 °C (27,000 °F).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Saturn has a prominent ring system, which is composed of dust and ice particles.\n",
      "* The rings are divided into several distinct rings, including a inner ring, a middle ring, and an outer ring.\n",
      "* The rings are composed of a mixture of dust and ice, with the dust particles being much larger than the ice particles.\n",
      "* The rings are also very bright, with a combined luminosity that is more than twice that of the Sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Satellites:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Saturn has 82 known moons, the most famous of which are Titan and Rhea.\n",
      "* Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede.\n",
      "* Rhea is the third-largest moon in the Solar System.\n",
      "* The moons of Saturn are very diverse, ranging in size, composition, and surface features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Significance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Saturn is a fascinating and awe-inspiring planet that has captured the attention of scientists and space enthusiasts for centuries.\n",
      "* It is a prime example of a terrestrial planet that has been modified by the effects of cosmic radiation and gravitational interactions.\n",
      "* Saturn is also a valuable resource for studying the processes that shape planetary bodies.\n",
